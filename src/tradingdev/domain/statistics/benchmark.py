"""Buy-and-hold benchmark returns and a strategy's regression on them.

All functions take series supplied by the caller, such as daily returns from
:func:`tradingdev.domain.statistics.periods.period_returns`, and never read
runs, artifacts, or caches.

The headline question, "does the strategy beat buy-and-hold", is a Sharpe
difference with an interval. That is a paired comparison already served by
:func:`tradingdev.domain.statistics.comparison.difference_interval`::

    difference_interval(
        strategy, benchmark, partial(sharpe_ratio, periods_per_year=365)
    )

This module adds what a difference of one statistic cannot express: how the
strategy co-moves with the benchmark (:func:`compare_to_benchmark`).

Reading the results:

* Beta here is not systematic risk. The strategy trades the same instrument
  as the benchmark, so the regression slope mostly measures the strategy's
  average net exposure to that instrument (1.0 always long, 0.0 flat on
  average or balanced long and short, negative net short), not a market
  beta in the CAPM sense. Alpha is correspondingly the return not explained
  by that average exposure, which includes any timing skill.
* The benchmark pays no transaction costs and the strategy does. This is
  deliberate and fair: costs are part of what a strategy has to overcome to
  beat holding the asset, so do not "fix" it by charging the benchmark.
* Both series must cover the same bars. They are always aligned with
  :func:`tradingdev.domain.statistics.comparison.align_returns`, which keeps
  only the periods both cover; build the benchmark from the same bars and
  the same ``frequency`` as the strategy returns.
* Annualisation uses the caller's ``periods_per_year``, as in
  :mod:`tradingdev.domain.statistics.sharpe`. Point estimates scale means
  by ``periods_per_year`` and standard deviations by
  ``sqrt(periods_per_year)``, which assumes independent periods, while
  :func:`difference_interval` uses a stationary bootstrap that keeps their
  autocorrelation. The point estimate and the interval therefore rest on
  different assumptions; with autocorrelated returns the annualised point
  estimates are biased, and the interval is the better guide to precision.

Conventions:

* Undefined figures (too few periods, zero benchmark dispersion, zero
  tracking error, no up or down periods) are ``None`` rather than
  infinities or zeros.
* A range of returns no wider than ``NEGLIGIBLE_SPREAD`` times
  ``max(1, largest absolute return)`` is rounding noise and counts as
  zero dispersion. A fully invested strategy computes its returns from a
  scaled price curve, so its active returns differ from buy-and-hold only
  by rounding; without this rule that noise would be reported as a
  tracking error and an arbitrary information ratio. The floor of 1
  reflects where the noise arises: a return is ``closing / opening - 1``,
  whose rounding error is about one machine epsilon of the ratio near 1
  however small the return, so a quiet instrument does not lower it.
* Both series must use the same kind of index, such as the UTC period
  starts of :mod:`tradingdev.domain.statistics.periods`. A timezone-naive
  index shares no label with a UTC one, which raises as having no common
  period.
* Non-finite returns or duplicate index labels raise ``ValueError``.

        down_capture: The same over the periods where the benchmark fell.
