# Strategy Contract

Generated strategies are runtime artifacts managed by MCP. They are saved under
`workspace/generated_strategies/<strategy_id>/revisions/<revision_id>/` with
`strategy.py`, `config.yaml`, and `metadata.json`. Source and base config are
immutable through the service; metadata records the selected revision's lifecycle
and validation evidence. `current.json` in the strategy directory points to the
most recently saved revision.
Bundled strategies are engineering-maintained code under
`src/tradingdev/domain/strategies/bundled/`.

Generated code must pass the repository's Ruff and strict Mypy rules from
`pyproject.toml`, including the Pydantic plugin and explicit dependency overrides.
The installed wheel carries this same policy. Caller-local configuration cannot
relax it. Mypy follows imports silently so diagnostics target the generated file;
unknown imports and missing annotations are still rejected.

## Python Contract

`random_seed` is a single top-level YAML setting: a strict integer in
`0..4294967295` or `null` (independent entropy). `backtest.random_seed` is rejected.
Use `tradingdev.domain.randomness.get_random()` or `get_numpy_rng()` for run-local
Python and NumPy generators; `get_seed()` supplies an explicit seed to a
third-party model's `random_state` when needed. These functions require an active
execution context, including the strategy constructor. Validation and dry-run each
start a fresh context; a backtest or walk-forward run shares one stream throughout
its constructor and evaluation/folds. Each optimization trial and its out-of-sample
evaluation starts its own context with the recorded run seed, independent of trial
completion order. Nested contexts restore their parent on success or failure.
These APIs do not seed arbitrary global RNG calls, third-party engines, or GPU
operations. Separate concurrent strategy executions must each open a context;
strategy-created threads or processes must explicitly initialize their own streams.

`get_strategy_contract.config_schema` describes the complete YAML shape. Fixed
configuration sections reject unknown fields; strategy parameters remain dynamic.
Validation and dry-run validate this same run configuration before strategy code
executes and return `effective_config` for checking the request against defaults.
A valid configuration does not by itself prove that every natural-language
requirement has been fulfilled.

Generated code must:

- inherit `tradingdev.domain.strategies.base.BaseStrategy`;
- expose a constructor that can be called with YAML `strategy.parameters`;
- accept optional `backtest_engine` or `parallel_config` when it needs application
  execution context;
- implement `generate_signals(df)` and return a new pandas DataFrame;
- preserve the input DataFrame without mutation;
- include a `signal` column containing only `1`, `-1`, or `0`;
- avoid network, subprocess, destructive filesystem, dynamic import, `eval`, and
  `exec`.

Backtest execution requires finite, strictly positive prices. Signal mode checks
`close` and any supplied `open` across all bars, using `close` for execution when
the `open` column is absent. On bars with logged order attempts (filled, ignored
or rejected), execution-record validation additionally requires nonmissing `high`
and `low` values to be finite and strictly positive. Absent or missing values
(including NaN) are recorded as `null` in those market fields, without filling
them from `close`. This additional high/low check does not apply to bars without
logged order attempts. Volume mode checks OHLC across all bars, using `close` for
absent `open`, `high`, or `low` columns.

When supplied, the `timestamp` column or DatetimeIndex must contain valid,
nonmissing, unique, increasing timestamps; they are normalized to UTC.

Volume mode applies optional `size_weight` values to the following bar with
`shift(1).fillna(1.0)`. The resulting weights must be finite and strictly positive;
zero is not a trade-suppression flag. Emit `signal=0` to prevent new entries; set
`signal_as_position: true` if zero should also close an existing position.

Validation, dry-run, backtest and walk-forward use the same constructor binding:
YAML parameters become keyword arguments. Missing required parameters and names
the constructor cannot accept fail validation. `backtest_engine` and
`parallel_config` are injected by the application and cannot be overridden in
YAML. Saving a revised draft
creates a new revision and loads that source, including
same-size edits made within one filesystem timestamp interval. An existing
revision is never replaced by a later save.

Execution submission captures every declared constructor default, excluding the
injected execution context, as an explicit keyword value in
`manifest.strategy_execution`. The saved revision YAML remains unchanged;
`manifest.config.strategy.parameters` may expand to the effective captured
parameters for an MCP experiment. Defaults must be finite JSON values;
unsupported defaults require explicit serializable parameters or a revised
strategy. Generated code must express configurable values as constructor
parameters rather than derive hidden defaults from environment state. This
captures declared arguments, not arbitrary Python behavior or dependency versions.

Allowed import roots for generated strategies are intentionally small:

- Python standard library: `__future__`, `collections`, `dataclasses`,
  `datetime`, `enum`, `math`, `statistics`, `typing`.
- Runtime libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `talib`, `typing_extensions`.
- Project APIs: `tradingdev`.

Prefer `tradingdev.domain.indicators` (`sma`, `ema`, `rsi`, `macd`,
`bollinger_bands`, `atr`, `adx`, `stochastic`) for standard indicators. This
facade calls the official TA-Lib Python wrapper, preserves the input index,
and exposes named result fields for indicators with multiple outputs. Bundled
strategies and feature engineering must use this facade rather than call
TA-Lib directly. Bollinger Bands use population standard deviation.

The facade preserves TA-Lib's native warm-up NaNs and NaN propagation, including
NaNs that can extend to the end of the output after an interior missing value.
Short inputs therefore remain unready for indicators whose full lookback has
not elapsed. Keep signals flat until every value required by the signal is
finite; do not backfill indicators from future rows or substitute zero for
unavailable indicator values. OHLC inputs must have identical indexes and
lengths, and infinite input values are rejected. Empty inputs produce empty
float64 outputs with the same index.

Periods must be integers other than booleans and at most 100,000. SMA, EMA,
RSI, ADX, Bollinger Bands, and MACD fast/slow periods require at least 2 bars;
ATR, MACD signal, and Stochastic periods allow 1. Bollinger Bands expose only
population standard deviation: the previous `ddof` parameter is removed.
The `std` argument to `bollinger_bands` must be finite and in the inclusive
range `0 <= std <= 3e37`. Negative values, values above `3e37`, NaN, and
positive or negative infinity raise `ValueError`.

Generated strategies may also import `talib` directly. Use its Function API
with float64 NumPy arrays, unpack multi-output tuples, and restore the input
index when constructing pandas Series. The output order is `line, signal,
histogram` for `MACD`, `upper, middle, lower` for `BBANDS`, and `k, d` for
`STOCH`; these are not pandas-ta DataFrames with parameter-encoded column names.
The same warm-up and missing-value rules apply. The import allowlist rejects
`pandas_ta`; existing generated strategies using it must be revised and
validated again. Static validation does not enforce the numerical rules above.

The public `indicator_column` helper has also been removed. Remove its imports
and calls, replacing pandas-ta column-name lookups with the facade's named
result fields, such as `macd(close).histogram` or `bollinger_bands(close).upper`.
When calling `talib` directly, unpack its output tuples in the order described
above instead. The facade's result objects expose named fields and are not
tuples to unpack.

Ruff treats `tradingdev` as first-party code. Separate its imports from
third-party `numpy`, `pandas`, and `talib` imports with a blank line.

Recommended imports:

```python

`save_strategy` assigns `strategy.id`, `strategy.revision_id`, and
`strategy.source_path` to the saved revision. These identity fields are managed
by the service; callers need not supply them. `strategy.version` remains optional
descriptive configuration, not the execution revision identifier.

Performance analysis uses Empyrical for return/risk metrics and VectorBT for
closed-trade statistics. `periods_per_year` is the explicit annualization factor
for observed UTC **daily returns**, independent of the strategy's bar timeframe:
365 for this continuously traded crypto example, or an appropriate trading-day
count for another market. Omitting it leaves annualized metrics unavailable.
`risk_free_rate` and `required_return` are annual decimal rates, converted to
daily rates using that factor. Calendar aggregation uses observed dates; missing
market data is not silently filled with zero returns. Maximum drawdown retains
bar-level resolution. `max_drawdown` is a nonnegative fraction;
`max_drawdown_amount` is a nonnegative amount in the portfolio's quote currency.
Calmar uses daily-return drawdown, exposed separately as `daily_max_drawdown`.
Daily observations require a declared bar timeframe of one day or finer. Weekly,
monthly, multi-day or unrecognized timeframes leave annualized metrics,
`daily_max_drawdown`, and daily/monthly PnL statistics unavailable. Multi-day
marks cannot locate daily closes or allocate PnL across month boundaries; no
daily equity is fabricated. `periods_per_year` always means days per year, so
setting it to 52 does not enable weekly annualization. Total return, total PnL,
bar-level drawdown and trade statistics remain available. Frequency validation
uses the declared timeframe, not gaps caused by weekends or missing data.
Optimization rejects objectives requiring these unavailable observations before
creating a job.
Volume mode has no initial capital, so capital-return metrics are unavailable;
use amount-based PnL and drawdown rather than interpreting missing returns as zero.
`total_trades`, `win_rate`, `profit_factor`, and `trade_expectancy` refer to closed
trades after entry and exit costs. Open trades are counted separately.

Run and job responses contain summaries. A metric omitted from a summary may still
be computed and saved: use `get_metric_catalog` for current definitions and
optimization directions, and `get_run_metrics(run_id, metric_ids, scope)` to read
saved values and their definition/settings snapshots. Use each run's
`available_scopes` for fold and trial results. Missing values include an explicit
reason and must not be interpreted as zero or a request to rerun the strategy.

Feature sources are explicit:

## Lifecycle

1. `save_strategy`: writes a new draft source/config revision and metadata,
   returns its `revision_id`, and updates the current pointer. Even an identical
   save creates a new revision; it does not inherit validation evidence.
2. `validate_strategy`: runs syntax, static policy, restricted import checks,
   ruff, mypy, inheritance, constructor, and the shared signal-contract gate on
   a short fixture for the selected revision. It returns that `revision_id` and
   structured diagnostics with `level`, `code`, `phase`, `message`, and optional
   `fix`.
3. `dry_run_strategy`: accepts only `validated` strategies, re-runs the same
   signal-contract gate on a longer fixture, returns `signal_analysis`, and
   marks the strategy runnable when it passes.
4. `promote_strategy`: strategy tool that marks a runnable generated strategy
   as promoted (owned by `StrategyService`).
5. `start_backtest` / `start_walk_forward` / `start_optimization`: execute only
   runnable or promoted generated strategies, and promoted bundled strategies.
   The gate is enforced
   again at execution time inside `BacktestService`, so the CLI and subprocess
   workers cannot bypass the lifecycle, and the config's `source_path` must
   match the selected revision's source.

Pass the `revision_id` returned by saving to get, validate, dry-run, promote,
and execution tools. Omitting it selects current once at the start of that
operation. Validation and dry-run persist evidence to that selected revision,
even if another save changes current while checks are running. A new draft B
does not revoke revision A's evidence, and B cannot inherit it.

Generated execution requires matching source/config hashes and successful
validation and dry-run records for the selected revision. Editing revision files
directly invalidates them; repair through a new save. An unknown explicit
revision never falls back to current. Submitted jobs, worker configs, completed
runs and strategy source artifacts remain tied to the selected revision when
current changes, including during optimization confirmation.

`cleanup_strategy_drafts(strategy_id, revision_ids=None, apply=False)` previews
retention decisions. Applying requires an explicit nonempty `revision_ids` list
and user authorization for those deletions; previewing alone never authorizes
removal. Only intact, non-current drafts with no persisted references are eligible.
Validated, runnable and promoted revisions remain, even when unused. All jobs
(including failed or cancelled ones), completed runs and orphaned manifests
protect their referenced sources. Unverifiable historical identities or malformed
records block cleanup; ambiguous old records with no revision also block it unless
their stored config establishes a legacy flat source for this strategy.

Responses report `applied` and each revision's `outcome` (`eligible`, `protected`,
`deleted`, `failed` or `missing`) with reasons. Apply rechecks eligibility under
the same per-strategy lifecycle lock used for publication, validation and status
updates. A changed preview can therefore become protected. Integrity failures,
symlinks and unexpected files prevent deletion. An apply containing protected
or failed items reports `success: false`; other eligible items can still be
deleted. Filesystem deletion is not transactional and an I/O failure may leave
a partial directory. A missing generated strategy returns `strategy_not_found`
before creating its lifecycle lock. Cleanup rechecks current after acquiring the
lock and also rejects the request if the strategy disappeared in between.
For an existing strategy, missing explicit revision IDs are reported as `missing`,
making a repeat apply safe. Omitting IDs on apply returns `cleanup_revision_ids_required`;
an untrustworthy reference scan or lock failure returns `strategy_cleanup_blocked`.
No background cleanup, automatic revision merging or migration occurs.

Each submission also fixes an execution manifest containing that strategy
identity, source hash, effective config with defaults, and any optimization
search specification. Effective constructor values, including nested bundled
parameter/fit-model defaults, are stored separately in `strategy_execution` and
consumed without filling new defaults in the worker. The start response returns
its `manifest_hash`, which
also appears on job status and completed runs. Workers recheck the manifest
against the submitted job and recheck strategy eligibility before execution.
Changing a separate runtime YAML after submission does not change the job;
submit a new job to change execution settings. The run's `config.yaml` is an
inspection projection, while `manifest.json` is the execution authority.

Runtime symbol, timeframe, and dates are separate from the revision's base
config. For generated strategies, ordinary backtest and walk-forward execution
configs may change `strategy.parameters` for experiments on the same runnable
revision. All other saved `strategy` fields, including
identity and any descriptive or constructor settings such as `description`,
`version` or `fit`, must remain unchanged. Changing those fields requires saving
and checking a new revision, even if identity and parameters are unchanged.
The comparison excludes the execution-managed `source_hash` and separately
verifies that `source_path` resolves to the selected revision's source. Copy the
saved config and apply market/date/cost changes outside the `strategy` section.
MCP `start_backtest` and `start_walk_forward` accept a `parameters` mapping;
overrides apply to the captured effective base parameters, including constructor
defaults. When both existing and supplied values are mappings, they merge
recursively; other values replace the specified parameter. At each merge level,
supplied keys must already exist in the captured mapping. A constructor accepting
`**kwargs` does not allow an override to introduce new keys. Unknown keys return
`invalid_execution_request` without creating a job. CLI configs instead provide
their complete experiment parameters, which must satisfy constructor binding
and the execution checks.
The base source, YAML, lifecycle evidence and current pointer remain unchanged.
Each run stores its own fixed parameters and constructor settings in its manifest.
Short and long signal-contract fixtures check the effective generated execution
settings at submission and execution, including when MCP `parameters` is omitted
or `null`; a failure rejects the experiment without changing the revision's
status. Static checks remain bound to the verified source.
Optimization may override only its search parameters, retaining all other base
parameters and all other saved strategy settings. Nested parameter candidates
recursively override only the specified fields of the fixed effective base;
other nested fields retain their captured values. Validation evidence covers
the base parameters; generated optimization candidates also pass the short and
long signal-contract fixtures before execution. Optimization fixes candidate lists,
metric, calendar training/test ranges, the metric's minimization or maximization
direction, and confirmation
policy in the manifest. A config with `validation` settings cannot also request
optimization; choose walk-forward or supply a config using the optimization
training/test split alone. The complete request does not freeze imported Python
dependencies, the engine environment, market data, or RNG state, and therefore
does not guarantee fully reproducible results. Bundled strategies remain
Git-managed and promoted with `revision_id: null`.

Legacy flat source/metadata/config files are not migrated or overwritten. They
cannot execute using their old lifecycle state. `list_strategies` discovers
root-level `<id>.json` names separately from current revisions, without parsing
legacy metadata or blocking bundled/current strategies. These entries have
`kind: legacy`, `status: revision_required`, `revision_id: null`, and
`code: strategy_revision_required`, with explicit resaving instructions.
`get_strategy(id)` reads the fixed `generated_strategies/<id>.py` and
`configs/<id>.yaml` locations as source/YAML recovery material; it does not follow
paths or trust lifecycle evidence from legacy metadata. Missing, unreadable,
non-UTF-8, or symlinked source/config files return `strategy_revision_invalid`;
their legacy entry remains discoverable. Restore the files or provide replacement
content to `save_strategy`, then validate/dry-run the newly returned revision.
Validate, dry-run, and promote reject legacy entries with
`strategy_revision_required`; execution still rejects them as non-executable.
A saved current revision supersedes its legacy discovery entry, leaving the old
files untouched. Explicit revision lookups never fall back to legacy files.
If a legacy entry shares a bundled ID, discovery lists both kinds and default
source lookup/execution selects bundled. Read the legacy source explicitly with
`get_strategy(strategy_id, legacy=true)` and save it under a different,
non-reserved ID; saving over bundled IDs returns `reserved_strategy_id`.
The explicit legacy query never falls back to bundled/current, and combining it
with `revision_id` returns `strategy_revision_invalid`.
Historical run records with no revision retain `revision_id: null`.

## Security Model

Validation currently uses static policy checks, including an import allowlist,
as a first layer. It rejects known unsafe imports (`os`, `sys`, `subprocess`,
`socket`, `requests`, `httpx`, `ccxt`, `shutil`, `pathlib`), dynamic execution
calls (`eval`, `exec`, `__import__`), raw `open`, and common destructive file
operations such as `unlink`, `remove`, `rmtree`, and `write_text`.
Static-policy or quality-gate errors stop validation before generated code is
imported or executed.

This is not a full process sandbox. `validate_strategy` and `dry_run_strategy`
still import and execute generated Python to check class loading, constructor
behavior, BaseStrategy inheritance, input immutability, signal values, and smoke
dataframe output.

Submission is another code-execution boundary. After checking that the selected
revision is executable, `start_backtest`, `start_walk_forward`, and
`start_optimization` call `StrategyLoader.resolve_execution` through
`BacktestService.prepare_execution` to capture constructor arguments and defaults
for the execution manifest. Loading a generated class compiles and executes its
module-level Python in the calling process (the MCP server for tool requests).
Before returning the manifest, `prepare_execution` also calls `check_execution`:
for every generated strategy, it constructs strategy instances from the captured
settings and calls `generate_signals` on 80-row and 240-row contract fixtures.
These checks run even when MCP `parameters` is omitted or `null`.
Optimization submissions check the captured base settings at this stage.
Optimization's parameter-grid preflight loads the class again, so module-level
code can execute more than once during submission. All of this happens before
creating a job or spawning a worker, and can have effects even if a later
preparation check rejects the request without a job.

For scheduled jobs, workers later repeat the generated execution-contract checks,
then construct and execute the strategy using the captured settings; generated
optimization candidates also undergo these checks before their trial runs.
These execution steps are separate from the earlier validation/dry-run and
submission checks. Worker supervision, worker timeouts and job cancellation do
not cover module loading, constructors or fixture signal generation that run in
the calling process before the worker exists. None of these checks provides a
process sandbox. Generated strategies must therefore be reviewed as runtime code
at all of these boundaries until a dedicated sandboxed execution layer is added.

`signal_analysis` includes row count, signal distribution, missing-signal count,
transition count, active-signal ratio, and timestamp bounds. Use it to debug
strategies that technically pass static checks but produce unusable signals.
