# Run Artifacts

TradingDev stores runtime metadata in `workspace/tradingdev.sqlite` and files
under `workspace/`.

## SQLite Tables

- `jobs`: generic background job status, job type, pid,
  `created_at`/`started_at`/`ended_at`, error, and payload. Backtest-specific
  fields such as strategy, symbol, timeframe, date range, and config path are
  nullable columns mirrored in the JSON payload when present. The payload also
  records `process_create_time`, the supervisor's OS creation time in Unix seconds,
  and `worker_control_id`, its unique launch token. The PID belongs to the
  supervisor, not the strategy-executing child.
- `runs`: completed run metadata, metrics JSON, config hash, source hash,
  random seed, dataset id, and artifact directory.
- `artifacts`: run and non-run artifact metadata, path, sha256, and metadata JSON.
- `events`: job-scoped structured events.

`job_id` and `run_id` are currently the same for completed backtest and
optimization jobs. `get_job_status(job_id)` returns the `run_id` once a run is
done.

`.workers/<launch_token>` stores the startup identity, worker startup response,
optional cancellation request (`stop`), and final cleanup acknowledgement. These
small records remain in a regular workspace so later sessions can verify cleanup
without trusting a potentially reused PID. Test workspaces remove them with the
rest of the temporary workspace after verified cleanup.

Cancellation of an active job without a complete control identity fails without
signalling or claiming that the process stopped. A queued job that has not started
a process can be cancelled directly. Status checks mark a started job failed when
its supervisor identity is missing or no longer matches; the first response
includes the same error persisted in the database. Spawn failures also persist
`failed`, an explanatory error and `ended_at` before propagating the exception.

## MCP Lookup

- `list_jobs` / `get_job_status` / `cancel_job`: operational progress and
  cancellation.
- `list_runs` / `get_run`: completed research results.
- `compare_runs`: side-by-side numeric metric comparison.
- `list_artifacts` / `get_artifact`: result JSON and other artifact lookup.
- `promote_strategy`: generated strategy artifact promotion.
- `record_feature_request`: structured unsupported feature requests.

Each completed run writes files under `workspace/runs/<run_id>/` and records
matching SQLite metadata:

- `result.json`: serialized metrics, stored as `result_json`.
- `config.yaml`: effective config snapshot used for the run, stored as
  `config_snapshot` with `config_hash`. For MCP-launched backtest and
  walk-forward and optimization jobs this snapshot includes the symbol, timeframe,
  and date range supplied to the start tool. Optimization includes the entire
  final calendar day; ordinary backtest bounds remain timestamps.
- `strategy.py`: generated or bundled strategy source snapshot when
  `strategy.source_path` is available, stored as `strategy_source` with
  source hash metadata. The same hash is indexed in `runs.source_hash` for
  direct SQL lookup.
- `dataset_fingerprint.json`: dataset id, symbol, timeframe, date range, and a
  fingerprint hash, stored as `dataset_fingerprint`.
- `pipeline_result.pkl`: full `PipelineResult` for dashboard rendering, stored
  as `pipeline_result` for completed backtest and walk-forward jobs.

The SQLite `runs.artifact_dir` value must match the corresponding
`workspace/runs/<run_id>/` directory. `runs.random_seed` records an explicit
top-level/backtest `random_seed`, or the unique `random_seed`/`random_state`/
`seed` value found under `strategy.parameters` when one exists. Run comparison,
dashboard rendering, and artifact lookup always read through SQLite first, then
resolve files from the recorded artifact paths.

Optimization `result.json` includes the best parameters, training metrics and
out-of-sample metrics. For newly saved results, its parsed JSON matches the
`metrics` object in the run record returned by `get_run`, not the entire MCP
response. Parameters outside the search grid retain their YAML values; selection
uses training results, and only the selected parameters are evaluated out of
sample.

Before writing `result.json` or SQLite `runs.metrics`, metric values are
recursively normalized: `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity` become JSON `null`,
including values inside nested objects and arrays such as optimization metrics.

Legacy results are also normalized in memory when `JobStore.load_result` reads a
result file or `SQLiteStore` reads run metrics. These reads do not rewrite the
stored file or database row. Consequently, `get_run`, `list_runs`, and completed
`get_job_status` responses expose legacy non-finite metric values as `null`.

In contrast, `get_artifact(include_content=true)` returns the original UTF-8 file
text without parsing or normalizing its contents. A legacy `result.json` may
therefore still contain `NaN` or `Infinity` even when result lookup returns `null`;
the content-equivalence statement above does not apply to these legacy artifacts.
The CLI displays missing or non-finite metrics as `N/A`, while keeping finite zero
values visible as zero.
