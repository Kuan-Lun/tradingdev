# ML Research

Input, validation and persistence contracts for synchronous ML research.
For strategy execution and training prerequisites, use the
[strategy contract](strategy_contract.md#training-before-scoring).
Workspace locations are listed in [Run Artifacts](run_artifacts.md#workspace-layout).

## ML Research Contract

The ML MCP tools are a separate synchronous research interface. They select
registered feature builders and estimators without generating a strategy,
preparing an execution plan or starting a backtest worker. A saved model is not
a runnable strategy revision and does not bypass the Python signal contract or
strategy lifecycle. User workflow is documented in the
[README](../README.md#研究機器學習訊號); file identities and persistence rules are in
[ML Research Artifacts](ml_research.md#ml-research-artifacts).

`get_ml_contract` returns schema version 1 discovery information: named feature
sets with ordered columns, model kinds with default parameters, validation
schemes, rolling schemes with their window type and default cadence, processor
types, IC methods, quantile limits, calendar modes, missing policies and rankable
metrics. Use these returned names rather than constructing arbitrary model
classes. `processor_types` advertises domain building blocks
only: `build_dataset`, `build_panel` and `train_model` do not accept or execute a
processor pipeline. In particular, training does not implicitly fit a scaler
because its name appears in discovery.

### Dataset and Model Inputs

`build_dataset` and `build_panel` select cached OHLCV by source, effective
`market_type`, exact symbol and timeframe. Binance Vision defaults to `futures/um`
and also accepts `spot`; providers that ignore market type store it as `null`.
The effective source/market is returned in the build summary, saved in dataset
metadata and participates in its identity.
Each requested year slice requires a covering successful query acquired at least
seven days after that slice ended. Missing coverage, unsettled acquisition or an
empty selected period fails; success does not establish complete bar coverage.
Use `ensure_data` with the same source/market when a download is needed. For recent
intervals, wait until the seven-day boundary before querying again: an immediate
retry cannot make recent observations reusable. Legacy unidentified flat files
are preserved but excluded. Builds never download, refresh or remove market data.
See [Market Data Cache](run_artifacts.md#market-data-cache).
The feature builder preserves rows and emits unavailable values
during warm-up. The service computes `forward_return = close[t+horizon] /
close[t] - 1` and `target = sign(forward_return)`, then drops incomplete feature
or label rows and reports their count. `horizon` is a positive number of source
bars, not elapsed calendar days. OHLCV and bookkeeping columns are not added to
the model's declared feature list.

XGBoost and SafetyVolume's optional direction model label their training frames
through `FeatureEngineer`: negative, zero and positive forward returns map to
`-1`, `0` and `1`. GLFT-ML uses `DirectionFeatureEngineer`, where `1` means a
positive return and `0` means a non-positive return. Both omit rows whose label
endpoint is unavailable, including the final horizon bars and missing interior
prices. Inference without targets retains those rows when their features are
complete. Quantile and SafetyVolume's risk model use their separate target
builders; they also leave outcomes beyond the supplied frame unavailable.

Bundled GLFT ML aligns predictions back to every original market row after
feature filtering, in both parameter search and formal signal generation.
Missing predictions prevent new entries; existing positions still age and
evaluate exits on the full price timeline. Filtering supervised training rows
does not compress the bars used to evaluate trades.

`FeatureEngineer.transform()`, `DirectionFeatureEngineer.transform()` and
`RiskFeatureEngineer.transform()` preserve
surviving source index labels; there is no index-reset option. Callers needing
row positions supply a positional index.
SafetyVolume maps optional ML directions to those source rows. XGBoost rolling
prediction skips a bar whose own features are unavailable, rather than reusing
an earlier prediction. Its threshold search evaluates the complete source frame,
leaves unavailable rows without entry signals, and measures cooldown in source
bars, including gaps.

SafetyVolume's rolling Risk Gate also predicts only from the current source
bar's features. If they are unavailable, it keeps the neutral `P(safe)=0.5`
instead of assigning an earlier bar's probability. Its state machine still uses
the configured risk threshold and holding rules; a missing risk feature does not
unconditionally flatten a position. Threshold search continues to evaluate its
filtered validation feature rows, unlike Quantile's full-frame gap handling.

The XGBoost and FLAML direction model training APIs require at least one labelled
training row. A supplied validation frame must also be non-empty. Empty inputs
raise `ValueError` before model state changes or external training starts,
preserving any previously fitted model. XGBoost's lookback search requires at
least 10 mature training rows and 5 mature validation rows per candidate, after
feature and label filtering. It skips insufficient candidates and raises
`ValueError` if none qualifies, without installing a default lookback or refitting
the model. Rolling retraining retains its previous model when the available
window has fewer than 10 complete labelled rows.

Both `build_dataset` and `build_panel` pass their date bounds to
`DataService.load_cached`. Bounds without a timezone are interpreted as UTC;
bounds with an offset are converted to UTC. Rows are selected with
`start_date <= timestamp <= end_date`, including both endpoints. A date-only
`end_date: "2024-01-31"` therefore stops at `2024-01-31T00:00:00Z`, not at the
end of January 31. For all hourly bars dated within January, use explicit bounds,
for example these `build_dataset` arguments:

```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC/USDT",
  "timeframe": "1h",
  "start_date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end_date": "2024-01-31T23:59:59.999999Z",
  "feature_set": "returns",
  "horizon": 1
}
```

The selected end bounds the source bars, so trailing rows whose forward label
needs later prices are still dropped. Reversed bounds fail; the loader does not
extend them to obtain missing labels. This timestamp contract differs from a
strategy walk-forward's explicit date split and optimization's inclusive UTC
calendar-day bounds. Explicit walk-forward dates first convert offsets to UTC,
then discard the time of day; the range is
`UTC midnight of start day <= timestamp < UTC midnight after end day`.
For example, `2024-01-02T03:00:00+08:00` names the entire January 1 UTC day.
The confirmation document displays these effective UTC boundaries, including
the exclusive upper bound, alongside the original settings.
Do not copy the ML timestamp example into optimization, which accepts only
`YYYY-MM-DD` boundaries.

`build_panel` requires at least two distinct symbols. It sorts symbol identity,
builds each symbol's features and labels independently, then aligns the labelled
frames. `intersection` keeps common timestamps. `union` uses `missing_policy`:
`drop` removes dates that any symbol cannot supply, `error` rejects gaps, and
`forward_fill` carries prior observations up to `max_staleness` shared calendar
positions (`null` leaves that carry unbounded). Leading gaps cannot be filled
from future observations. Read the returned calendar coverage, dropped dates
and filled-row counts; filled rows are carried observations, not new trades.
`calendar.dropped_dates` and each `calendar.coverage[].missing` list contain at
most the first 50 dates; `n_dropped_dates` and each `n_missing` remain exact.
The saved manifest uses the same bounded calendar summary.

`train_model(dataset_id, model_kind, parameters, validation, ...)` resolves
effective model defaults plus declared parameter overrides; unknown parameter
names are rejected. It trains only the dataset's ordered feature columns plus
`target`. Standalone ML training uses the model's `random_state` parameter,
independently of the top-level strategy YAML `random_seed`.
Feature importance is sorted descending using each estimator's native
`feature_importances_` values. It is not a common cross-framework scale or a
universal gain measure.

The final persisted artifact is fitted on every dataset row, and
`in_sample_accuracy` evaluates those same training rows. Optional validation
fits additional models for its folds; it does not replace the artifact with a
fold model or persist an out-of-fold prediction stream. Preserve the returned
validation evidence if it is needed later.

MCP `predict` verifies the saved dataset and model blob, requires an exact ordered
feature-column match, then returns one page of `signal` and `forward_returns` in
dataset row order with their `model_id`, `dataset_id` and horizon. `offset` starts
at zero; `limit` defaults to 100 and accepts 1–500. `n_rows` is the complete
dataset count, not the page length; `next_offset=null` marks the final page.
`signal_fingerprint` hashes the complete signal in dataset row order, regardless
of `offset` or `limit`, for comparison with evaluation and leaderboard records.
`MLService.predict` retains complete arrays for backend and Python callers.
MCP evaluation does not require retrieving every preview page. Prediction does not establish
whether the requested data or its label interval was used for fitting or
parameter selection. Evaluating the final artifact on its training dataset is
in-sample even when the training response includes validation scores. A separate
test dataset must be reserved before selection, with training label intervals
ending before that test period, to support a chronological out-of-sample claim.

### Fold Validation and Signal Interpretation

Omitting `validation` skips fold validation. A supplied scheme uses the saved
label horizon for purging and an optional nonnegative `embargo` gap; callers
cannot replace the dataset's horizon with a more convenient value.
`n_folds` and `min_train_bars` must leave usable training and test data after
exclusions; unsupported schemes or insufficient data fail the request.

Folds are built on sorted distinct timestamps, not the panel's physical row
order. Every symbol on one timestamp shares the same training/test role.
`min_train_bars` counts distinct training timestamps, whereas returned
`train_bars`, `test_bars`, `purged_bars` and `embargoed_bars` count dataset rows.
The service retains each label's original `label_start` and `label_end` before
feature-row removal or calendar alignment. In addition to the horizon-based
gap, it excludes training dates whose label intervals touch the test interval;
one symbol's overlap excludes that date for all symbols. This also checks test
labels extending into the training window on the right in K-fold validation.
Datasets without the label intervals must be rebuilt before validation.

A panel containing forward-filled observations is rejected for fold validation:
its carried label describes the original observation, not a new sample at the
filled timestamp. Rebuild with `intersection` or `missing_policy="drop"` for
validation. Such panels can still be fitted without validation and passed to
`predict`; this is not evidence of an out-of-sample test.

- `purged_walk_forward` expands training through dates before each test window.
- `purged_kfold` trains on retained data outside each test window: later data for
  the first fold, earlier data for the last, and available data on either side
  for interior folds. This is retrospective cross-validation, not predictions
  that could have been made at the test date.

The response reports each fold's retained training/test rows, purged and
embargoed rows, accuracy, IC, Rank IC and hit rate, plus the mean of available
fold scores. Panel fold metrics are calculated separately in timestamp order
for each symbol, then averaged across symbols with available values; rolling
IC windows never cross from one symbol into another. Unavailable scores remain
`null`. `artifact_trained_on: all_bars`
distinguishes the final artifact from the fold models. `leakage_audit_clean`
describes the implemented split and label-overlap checks only; it cannot prove
that features, research choices or external inputs are free of future knowledge.

MCP `evaluate_signal(model_id, dataset_id, window=60, n_quantiles=5, record=False)`
evaluates a verified saved model on the complete single-symbol dataset. The
backend produces the signal, obtains saved forward returns in the same row
order and adopts the dataset horizon; the MCP input does not accept arrays or
a caller-selected horizon. A preview's `offset` or `limit` never restricts
evaluation. There must be enough observations for the chosen IC `window` and
`n_quantiles` (2–10). It returns Pearson and Spearman IC statistics, hit rate, turnover,
prediction strata and simplified return summaries. These signal statistics are
separate from backtest performance metrics and do not model transaction costs,
slippage or order execution. Full-sample strata and their quantile means are
descriptive comparisons, not fitted trading thresholds or out-of-sample evidence.
Ties can reduce the actual number of strata; do not infer their count from the
requested `n_bins` alone.

The simplified long/short and long-only streams use thresholds computed only
from earlier signals. The first `n_quantiles` observations are warm-up, and at
least two distinct past signal values are needed. With few distinct signals,
historical minimum/maximum select the tails; otherwise expanding quantiles do.
Only original positions `0, horizon, 2*horizon, ...` can open a trade, so the
holding intervals do not overlap. Other rows contribute zero. Cumulative values
compound these holding-interval returns; means include the inactive rows.
Returns are indexed by decision row, not realization time, and do not form a
mark-to-market equity curve. A constant signal cannot form a long/short book and
is rejected.

Additional performance statistics use only the holding grid, including its cash
intervals, with the benchmark on the same grid. Annualised statistics require a
verified continuous crypto calendar; annual return also requires positive capital
throughout. Unavailable values stay `null`. See the
[recorded-metric contract](ml_research.md#recorded-signal-evaluations) for the
market policy and storage rules.

The separate Python `MLService.evaluate_signal` accepts equal-length, finite
numeric signal and forward-return arrays. Without a dataset ID, that caller is
responsible for chronological single-asset alignment and the correct horizon;
omission defaults to one bar. Whenever `dataset_id` is supplied, including by
the MCP backend, evaluation requires a single-symbol dataset,
all of its rows, exact saved forward returns in order, and a matching horizon
(or omission to adopt the saved value), including when `record=False`.
Dataset rows must be strictly chronological, and saved label end times must
show non-overlapping holding intervals on the simulation grid. Datasets without
label intervals must be rebuilt for evaluation.
Panel evaluation is rejected; build a single-symbol dataset for evaluation.
Do not concatenate different assets into one time series. `record=True`
additionally requires the dataset ID for Python array callers.
The MCP path verifies which saved model produced the signal; it does not prove
a held-out evaluation. Python array callers and existing records may use a
caller-declared `model_id` label. Recording and candidate-replacement semantics are defined in the
[artifact contract](ml_research.md#recorded-signal-evaluations).
`leaderboard` ranks only a metric with a declared direction and, by default,
only matching measurement contexts. Its optional `dataset_id` filter selects a
verified dataset version and checks that recorded data context matches its
manifest; differences in evaluation settings still require compatible context.
`allow_parameter_axes=True` permits window, horizon and quantile-count variations
under the [parameter-surface rules](ml_research.md#recorded-signal-evaluations);
it does not make those measurements comparable. `allow_mixed=True` opts into
incompatible contexts and must not be presented as a controlled comparison. Retain its
`caveats`, skipped entries and candidate counts when interpreting the winner;
trying more candidates increases selection bias.

MCP `leaderboard` accepts `offset=0` and `limit=20` (1–100); it does not accept
`top_k`. The complete filtered candidate set is compared and ranked before
paging. `ranked` and `skipped` each return at most `limit` entries at the same
offset; `n_ranked` and `n_skipped` describe their complete counts. Follow the
shared `next_offset` until `null`, even if one list has no entries on a page.
Mixed-context rejection reports the full context count, limited examples and
filter guidance, not every context's text.

After inspecting saved candidates, discover the `ml` section with
`get_report_sections` and pass 1–50 distinct entry IDs to
`generate_report(ml_entry_ids=[...])`. This can produce an independent ML report
or attach independent evidence to selected runs/a fixed comparison. The report
uses the recorded candidates and never reruns prediction or training. Its default
ranking metric is `ic_mean`; `ml_ranking_metric` selects another directed metric,
and `ml_allow_parameter_axes=True` explicitly enables the same surface rules.
Missing or incompatible evidence fails instead of silently dropping candidates.
Deliver the returned report link and navigation instructions. The artifact saves
the selected content even if those leaderboard entries are later replaced; it
does not prove a model-to-run relationship or persist missing time series. Full
selection, visibility and retention semantics are in the
[report contract](reports.md#composable-offline-reports).

Leaderboard records do not retain the training/evaluation split or establish
whether evaluated rows participated in fitting or selection. A report built only
from those records therefore establishes neither in-sample nor out-of-sample
status. Describe the saved evaluation sample and keep that provenance unknown;
model IDs, dataset IDs and a `full` scope are not split evidence.

Model prediction unpickles trusted Python objects. Generated-strategy import
checks do not apply to those objects, and a matching hash is not a sandbox or
proof of a trustworthy publisher. Do not load model files from an untrusted
workspace.

### Rolling Retraining Schemes

The bundled `XGBoostStrategy` and `SafetyVolumeStrategy` retrain while they
score: every `retrain_interval` bars the engine attempts a refit, and each bar is
predicted with whichever model is current. A `rolling_gen` block declares that
window geometry instead of leaving it inside the strategy loop. It is **off by default**; with `enabled: false` the
strategy runs its classic retrainer, untouched. `get_ml_contract` advertises the
schemes under `rolling_schemes` — each entry carries `name`, `description`,
`rtype` and `default_step`, where a null `default_step` means the cadence follows
the strategy's own interval — and execution resolves them from the same registry,
so the menu and the geometry that actually runs cannot drift apart.

```yaml
strategy:
  parameters:
    rolling_gen:
      enabled: true      # off unless set
      scheme: roll_sd    # or roll_ex
      step: 720          # optional; follows retrain_interval
      window_size: 7200  # roll_sd only; follows 10 x lookback
```

- `roll_sd` slides a training window of `window_size` bars forward with each
  retrain. Early windows are clipped at the first bar, so they can be shorter
  than that length; a clipped window below `min_train_bars` skips the refit and
  keeps a previous model only when one is available.
- `roll_ex` keeps the first bar and expands the window with each retrain.

The scheme name fixes the window shape; there is no separate override, so a name
cannot describe one geometry while running another. `window_size` is accepted
only for `roll_sd` and is rejected for an expanding scheme rather than ignored.

`min_train_bars` and `predict_lookback` are optional as well; they follow
`lookback + 10` labelled rows and `2 x lookback` prior bars of scoring context.
`predict_lookback` counts bars *before* the scored one, which is then added on
top, so the default context is up to `2 x lookback + 1` rows, clipped to the
available history. It must also be at least
`lookback + 1`, otherwise the context could not cover the feature lookback and
geometry resolution raises before scoring. Resolution happens during signal
generation, so `fit()`'s
initial model already exists at that point; it is the rolling refits that never
start. Those defaults are derived from the strategy's own lookback on purpose: a
fixed window shorter than the feature warm-up would leave no labelled rows and
skip every refit, which the trace records as `trained: false` with the row count
the window offered. An enabled unknown scheme or a conflicting expanding
`window_size` is rejected earlier, when strategy configuration is validated.

A refit is skipped, and an available previous model kept, when the window holds fewer than
`min_train_bars` labelled rows or fewer than two bars at all. The trace records
`trained: false` for that roll, so a carried-over model is never mistaken for one
that saw the data. The initial fitted model is available only if its entire
training frame precedes the scored frame. An overlapping training replay waits
for its first successful refit; clipping history cannot remove future knowledge
from a fitted model. If no model becomes available during a nonempty replay,
execution fails with a model-availability error rather than reporting a successful
all-neutral run. These replay metrics remain in-sample diagnostics: lookback and
other strategy settings may still have been selected using the full training fold.

Whichever scheme is declared, a training window ends strictly before the bar it
scores, the scored frame is never concatenated in front of itself, and a bar
whose features are unavailable is not scored rather than reusing the previous
bar's value. Those are the same rules the classic retrainer follows in its own
loop. The engine adds one rule of its own: a training row whose label reads past
the last bar of the training window is dropped before fitting, whatever the feature engineer
returned. The classic retrainer has no such filter — it relies on the engineer
leaving that tail unlabelled for `dropna` to remove — which is why the engine
takes `label_horizon` explicitly and why an engineer that fills its unlabelled
tail cannot smuggle an unrealised outcome into an enabled run. A nonempty scored
frame in which no bar can be scored fails rather than returning all-zero signals;
an empty scored frame simply has nothing to score.

What an unscored bar becomes differs by consumer: the direction strategy emits
`0`, while the Safety Volume risk gate keeps its neutral `0.5`. Neither borrows a
neighbouring bar's value. The neutral score is an input, not a decision: it is
still compared against the strategy's effective threshold — `risk_threshold`, or
the value chosen from `risk_threshold_candidates` during `fit()` — so with a
threshold above `0.5` it blocks a new entry and, once the minimum holding period
has passed, triggers the configured risk exit for an open position.

The schedule can be printed before anything runs. `enumerate_rolls` returns one
window per retrain — the training bounds, the bar that triggered it, and the
interval that model is assigned to score — built from the same geometry the
engine executes, so it previews the run rather than describing a second one. The
intervals are planned, not observed: bars whose features are missing are not
scored, and the trace reports the actual count per roll. Training bounds and
`combined_idx` use the concatenated history-plus-scored frame; `retrain_bar`
and `test_start`/`test_end` use positions within the scored frame. Both window
intervals are half-open. The schedule and saved trace use the same coordinates;
`retrain_bar` identifies an attempt, while `trained` records whether fitting ran.

A run that enables the switch also records what actually happened. Each roll
reports its window, how many labelled rows it offered, whether a model was fitted
or the previous one kept, and how many of its bars were actually scored; the bars
that could not be scored at all are listed separately, so a bar's model can be
recovered from the trace without storing an entry per bar. A window shorter than
two raw bars is skipped before any feature work, so its `n_train_rows` is zero
because nothing was measured, not because it held no labels. The record lands in
the run's metric metadata as `rolling_trace`, beside `strategy_parameters`; it is
provenance, not a parameter, and it is absent whenever the switch is off.
`initial_model_available` records whether the initial fit could be used; before
the first successful refit, a skipped window can only score if this flag is true.
Saved traces are independent snapshots even if a strategy reuses its mutable hook
payload. The bundled strategies require training and therefore support this path
through walk-forward execution; the generic trace hook does not add simple
backtest or optimization support to them.
Metric queries return compact trace summaries and a reference to the full saved
artifact, so long histories do not expand every roll into the model context.
See [performance artifacts](performance_artifacts.md#performance-scopes-and-provenance)
for the summary fields and paged evidence retrieval.

This is not fold validation. `validation_schemes` cut one dataset into
train/test folds to estimate the training procedure; `rolling_gen` decides how
an already fitted strategy refits and predicts bar by bar. Date anchoring is not
implemented: declaring `train_start` is rejected instead of silently ignored.

## ML Research Artifacts

ML datasets, feature matrices, trained models and signal evaluations use the
workspace directories listed in [Run Artifacts](run_artifacts.md#workspace-layout). They do not create background jobs, backtest runs
or SQLite artifact registrations. Dataset and model IDs refer to their own
stores; they are not run IDs.
Reports generated from these records are separate registered artifacts; their
publication and retention are defined in [Reports](reports.md#composable-offline-reports).

### Immutable Datasets

`MLDatasetStore` publishes schema version 2 datasets as a complete directory
containing `dataset.parquet` and `manifest.json`. The manifest records:

- The single symbol or ordered panel symbols, timeframe, requested date range,
  source and dataset kind.
- Feature-set name, ordered feature columns, build-time feature-code fingerprint,
  label column, label horizon and dropped-row count.
- For panels, the calendar settings, coverage summary and date count. As in the
  tool response, dropped/missing date lists each contain at most 50 dates;
  `n_dropped_dates` and each `n_missing` remain exact.
- `schema_version`, `rows`, the SHA-256 `content_hash` of the exact Parquet bytes,
  and `dataset_id`.

The Parquet frame retains `label_start` and `label_end`: the original source-bar
timestamps used to calculate each row's forward return, captured before feature
rows are dropped or a panel calendar is aligned. Panel labels are computed on
each symbol's own bars. Forward filling carries these timestamps together with
the original label; it does not turn that label into a newly observed outcome
at the filled calendar date. Fold validation refuses panels with carried
observations and requires rebuilding with intersection or dropped missing dates.

`dataset_id` is `ds_` followed by the first 16 hexadecimal characters of the
SHA-256 of the sorted JSON manifest, excluding `dataset_id` itself. Thus metadata,
feature code and the saved data bytes all participate in identity. Rebuilding
after an input or feature-code change publishes a different version rather than
replacing the previous dataset. Cache-hit status is response metadata only and
does not change dataset identity.

Publication holds `.publish.lock` across the existence check and same-directory
rename of a completed temporary directory. An existing ID is reused only after
its data and manifest pass verification and its manifest matches the proposed
one; a collision or corrupt existing version fails without replacing it.
Temporary publication directories are removed on success and failure. The lock
file remains available to coordinate later writers.

Every dataset load validates the ID syntax, schema, manifest identity, Parquet
content hash and row count before exposing a frame. Hashing and parsing use the
same bytes. Missing, incomplete or altered versions fail rather than rebuilding
silently. Earlier dataset schemas are unsupported and must be rebuilt; reads do
not migrate, delete or rewrite their files. These hashes detect inconsistent
content, not a writer able to replace both the manifest and its data.

Schema 2 alone does not establish that label intervals are present. Fold
validation additionally requires both interval columns; single-symbol
evaluation requires `label_end` and chronological `timestamp` rows to check its
holding intervals. Earlier schema 2 datasets missing the required columns must
also be rebuilt for those operations. The generic store does not infer missing
intervals or modify an old version. Validation and evaluation semantics are
defined in the [ML research contract](ml_research.md#fold-validation-and-signal-interpretation).

### Feature Matrix Cache

`ml_feature_cache/<cache_key>.parquet` stores a feature matrix, with a JSON
sidecar describing the symbol, timeframe, input-data fingerprint, feature set,
code fingerprint, feature and stored columns, row count, content hash and last
use time. Labels are constructed after the cache lookup, so changing the label
horizon can reuse the same feature computation.

The cache key includes bar values, symbol, timeframe, feature set and feature
code. The default code fingerprint hashes the feature package's relative source
paths, source bytes and registered column declarations; it does not depend on
the installation's absolute path or a Git checkout. An application caller may
explicitly supply that fingerprint. Dataset manifests retain the fingerprint
used at build time, so later evaluation does not substitute the currently
installed feature code's identity.

A cache hit requires matching computation metadata and feature columns, a
matching Parquet hash, and matching stored columns and row count. Sidecars must
contain a JSON object with string identity fields and SHA-256 hash, a nonnegative
integer row count, and distinct string lists for stored and feature columns;
feature columns must be present in the stored columns. A present last-use time
must be finite and numeric. Malformed metadata, missing files, hash or shape
mismatches and invalid Parquet content are cache misses, allowing the service
to recompute and replace the disposable cache entry. The matrix is parsed from
the same bytes whose hash was verified. Recomputing does not replace source
market files or immutable dataset versions.

Each cache directory has a persistent `.feature-cache.lock` shared by processes.
It serializes complete writes and eviction, reads through their recency update,
and key/statistics snapshots, so an in-progress publication cannot be swept as
an orphan. The default lock wait is 30 seconds; expiration raises a timeout
instead of reporting a cache miss. Matrix and sidecar publication use unique
temporary files in the cache directory, with cleanup on success or failure;
cleanup errors follow the I/O policy below. The lock file is retained and excluded from retention bytes,
as are temporary files. This lock covers the disposable feature cache only.

Verification reads and cache publication propagate permission and other storage
I/O failures; these are not reported as misses. Updating recency is best effort
and logs a warning if it fails, as does an unsuccessful eviction deletion.
The default retention limits are 256 entries and 512 MiB, counting matrices and
sidecars. Successful reads update recency; writes sweep incomplete pairs and evict least
recently used entries. The just-written entry is protected, so a matrix larger
than the byte budget remains stored and logs a warning. Failed deletions may
also leave the cache above its limits. These are retention targets, not a hard
disk quota; feature-cache eviction does not delete the immutable datasets that
already contain the computed features.

### Trained Models

`models/<model_id>.json` holds schema 1 metadata; the matching `.bin` holds the
pickled model wrapper. Metadata records model name, framework, kind, effective
parameters, ordered features, training-row count, available feature importance
and full blob SHA-256. At build time, the ID is computed as a 16-character
SHA-256 prefix over name, parameters, ordered features and blob hash. It
identifies model content, not a training execution or saved validation result.

Save and load verify the blob hash and recompute the ID from its identity fields.
Loading also checks that the metadata ID matches the requested filename. Framework,
kind, training-row count and feature importance are not identity fields; changes
to those fields may still go undetected. Metadata is not compared with the
serialized estimator, and the ID neither authenticates publishers nor proves all
metadata unchanged. Prediction checks exact ordered dataset features and unpickles
the same bytes that passed hash verification.

Writers for one model ID hold `.<model_id>.lock`. A new blob is staged beside its
destination and atomically published; an existing blob must have the same hash and
is never truncated or replaced. Metadata is published last by atomic replacement,
so concurrent readers see complete records and can continue using an existing model
during repeated training. Temporary files are removed on success and failure; the
lock file is retained. A failed first publication removes its newly created blob
if no metadata was published. This is not a crash or power-loss transaction:
an interrupted, unpublished blob can be recovered by retrying the same content.

The schema 1 filenames remain unchanged. `ModelArtifactStore.load_with_bytes`
returns the verified metadata and bytes together; `load` returns only metadata.
Saving no longer accepts an alternate `model_id`, and the unchecked
`load_model_bytes` helper is removed.

CatBoost removes random `model_guid` and wall-clock `train_finish_time` metadata
before serialization, avoiding identities driven by those incidental values.
This does not guarantee identical blobs across dependency versions or environments.
Pickled wrappers are tied to the training environment, not a portable model
exchange format. After a Python or ML dependency upgrade, retrain in the new
environment and use the returned model ID. Schema 1 does not record dependency
versions or enforce compatibility; a valid blob hash cannot establish that an
older pickle is loadable in the current environment.

Pickle requires trusted workspace files. Hashing is not authentication or a
sandbox; a writer able to replace metadata and blob can supply executable code.
The final artifact fits all dataset rows even when training returns fold scores;
its ID or predictions on those rows do not establish out-of-sample evidence.

### Recorded Signal Evaluations

MCP `evaluate_signal(model_id, dataset_id, record=True)` generates the complete
signal from a verified saved model and single-symbol dataset, then records its
evaluation. Preview pages are not persisted prediction artifacts and are never
the evaluation's input. The separate Python `MLService.evaluate_signal` accepts
arrays and requires a verified dataset when recording.
Whenever `dataset_id` is supplied, including without recording, the signal must
cover all its rows, the supplied forward returns must exactly match the saved
`forward_return` values in row order, and an explicit horizon must equal the
saved horizon; omitting it adopts the saved value. The saved interval endpoints
must support non-overlapping trades on the simulation grid. Panel datasets are
refused for evaluation. Non-finite signal or return values are rejected, rather
than dropped before recording. Without `record=True`, evaluation returns its
result without a leaderboard write.

`ml_leaderboard/leaderboard.jsonl` contains one JSON record per `entry_id`, sorted
by ID. Each record preserves finite metrics, observation count, model and dataset
IDs, a display label, the candidate's own fitted hyperparameters, the hash of the
signal that was measured, and an evaluation context: symbol or panel symbols,
timeframe, requested period, horizon, IC window, quantile count, feature set,
build-time code fingerprint and dataset content hash. The fitted parameters are
copied from the model artifact, so a row still says how that model was configured
after the artifact is retrained. Ad-hoc signals and records whose model artifact
cannot be loaded have empty parameters. Older records missing the new fields
read as `parameters={}` and `signal_fingerprint=""`; reads do not reconstruct them.
Empty parameters are not fitted defaults, and an empty fingerprint is not
reproduction evidence. Re-evaluate and record to obtain that evidence.
Comparison uses the saved context; changed data or feature code does not silently
inherit an old context.

The recorded metrics include annualised return, maximum drawdown, Sharpe, alpha
and beta alongside the signal-quality ones. They describe the simulated
long/short book built from the predictions: costs are excluded and no order was
ever sent, so they are not backtest results. Alpha and beta regress that book
against holding the measured asset over the same intervals, which makes them a
statement about market exposure rather than about an unrelated index. Annualised
figures use only the non-overlapping decision grid, including its cash intervals.
They require a crypto-only provider and consecutive label intervals matching the
declared timeframe and horizon, using the shared 365-day crypto policy. Without
that evidence (including Yahoo, gaps or no dataset), they are `null`. Annualised
return is also `null` if compounded capital becomes nonpositive; subsequent
losses cannot revive a bankrupt book into a profitable candidate.

A metric that comes out NaN or Inf is stored as an explicit `null`, never removed
from newly written records. Three states therefore stay distinguishable: a key that is
absent was never recorded, a key holding `null` is unavailable or non-finite, and a
finite value is an ordinary measurement. This matters for parameter surfaces. If
the run at `window=20` fails, deleting its score would leave `window=10` and
`window=30` looking adjacent, and any slope or flatness fitted along that
shortened axis would be wrong. A candidate with no score is skipped when ranking,
but its `skipped` row still reports its horizon, window and quantile count, and
the response's `parameter_axes` still lists the value it was measured at.
Older evaluations dropped unavailable values: a missing key there cannot establish
whether a metric was unmeasured or unavailable. Re-evaluate and record when that
distinction is needed; reading an old record does not recover missing evidence.

Consumers must read `null` as a gap at a known coordinate. A consumer whose own
type cannot represent null must keep the coordinate and record validity beside
the value: when a number is unavoidable, write `0` as a placeholder and mark the
row invalid. `0` is never a substitute for a missing score, because zero is a
perfectly plausible IC or Sharpe, so a slope, flatness or ranking computed over
placeholder zeros is meaningless until the validity mask is applied.

`domain/ml/report.py` provides the pure projection used by `ReportService` for
explicitly selected saved ML candidates. `ml_signal_scope` produces a scope
per recorded candidate: `kind` is `ml_signal` and `mode` is `signal`, so a reader
cannot mistake it for a backtest; `values` keeps the same three-state `null`
behaviour; `observations` is present and null, because a signal evaluation
records no orders and no equity curve. The three tunable settings are reported
in `metadata`, not merged into `parameters`: a fitted parameter dictionary may
legitimately contain a key of the same name, and merging would silently
overwrite one of them, so `parameters` means exactly what the model was fitted
with. Non-finite scores become `null`, as in leaderboard storage, while absent
metric keys remain absent. `ml_report_block` collects the whole candidate set,
including candidates that failed to rank, with block-level definitions, the
observed parameter axes, the skipped rows and their coordinates, and the ranking
caveats. It accepts the complete candidate list and a ranking metric, computing
the ranking and selection caveats together from those candidates rather than
accepting an independent or truncated ranking. `alpha` sets the family-wise
significance level. Duplicate entry IDs raise `ValueError`. Comparability uses
the leaderboard rules: settings must match by default; pass
`allow_parameter_axes=True` for a surface, which still requires one research
identity and one dataset version per horizon. Cross-horizon source equivalence
remains unverified and is disclosed in the caveats.

Signal metric definitions now carry the two fields a portfolio metric definition
already had, `modes` and `requires_annualization`, so one definition shape
serves both. `modes` is always `signal`; only annualised return, Sharpe and alpha
require annualisation. Newly built `SignalEvaluationBundle` definitions record
both fields. Older definitions without the flag load with
`requires_annualization=null` (unknown), not `false`; their original semantics
are not inferred from today's catalog. Explicit saved values remain unchanged.
The projection's definitions come from the current signal catalog because
leaderboard rows do not store definition snapshots; they are not historical
producer definitions recovered from those rows. Report selection, presentation
and snapshot publication are defined in [Reports](reports.md#composable-offline-reports).

`leaderboard(dataset_id=...)` verifies and selects one immutable dataset
version, so models on it can be compared separately from rebuilt versions.
Records must match its manifest's data context and row count; unknown or invalid
IDs fail. Other filters combine with this selector. Different IC windows or
quantile counts require `allow_parameter_axes=True` or `allow_mixed=True`; neither
bypasses dataset verification.

`allow_parameter_axes=True` is the narrower opt-in a sensitivity study needs: it
permits horizon, IC window and quantile count to differ under these constraints.
Instrument or panel symbols, timeframe, period, feature set and code fingerprint
must still match, and one horizon may hold only one dataset ID and content hash, because a new horizon
rebuilds its labels on its own dataset. Across horizons, provider and underlying
source-bar equivalence are not verified. Inspect dataset manifests and source
data separately before treating the sweep as a controlled comparison; the tool
reports this limitation in its caveats. A ranking across those axes describes a
parameter surface, not one comparable measurement, so the response reports the
observed values of each axis and appends a caveat saying so. Every row states its
own horizon, window and quantile count, so a point on the surface is readable
without a second lookup.

The entry ID includes the dataset, evaluation context and model ID.
With no model ID, it also includes a signal fingerprint computed from a
canonical JSON array of finite floating-point values; array boundaries and value
boundaries are preserved. That fingerprint is now computed for every record and
stored in its own `signal_fingerprint` field, including records that carry a model
ID, where it is deliberately kept out of the ID: folding it in would rename every
existing entry. A re-run reproduces a recorded candidate when its
`signal_fingerprint` equals the stored one, and no migration is needed. MCP
evaluation validates the model that generated its
signal. Existing records and Python array callers may instead use a
caller-declared model label: their ID alone does not prove signal origin. The
stored format has no provenance discriminator, so a leaderboard must not label
all historical rows as verified-origin. Neither path proves out-of-sample
evaluation. Repeating a model/dataset/context entry
replaces its earlier metrics, including when the caller supplies different
signal values. Distinct unlabelled signals remain separate candidates.

`LeaderboardStore.record` holds `.leaderboard.lock` across its read, update and
write. It flushes a unique temporary file beside the destination and atomically
replaces the JSON-lines file. `entries` reads without locking and sees a complete
old or new file. Temporary files are removed after successful and failed writes, and
the lock file is retained. Re-recording an entry returns `replaced=True` rather
than increasing the candidate count. Unreadable records fail the read instead
of being skipped and silently reducing that count.
